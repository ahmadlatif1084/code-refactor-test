The code practises are very pathetic. I refactored Booking Controller and some
functions of Booking repository. I spent almost 3 hours and i feel like very bad
after looking into this code practises. Everyone has its own point of view.
Mine cannot be agreeable with you. Well i don't go deep into Booking repository
code refactoring, because it is still the worst code practise. Well these
are my principals by which you can judge me.


I Select the code refactoring part.

1) Syntax errors
2) Unnecessary conditions used in code.
3) Better code practises not followed.
4) Code Quality can be improved a hell better. Whether i don't know the
working of code. But will decrease code line and hierarchy code structure.

How we can improve ?

1) Better declaration of variables.
2) Remove unnecessary variables.
3) Use Ternary Operators.
4) Use switch statement.
5) Use Validator Requests.
6) Use CamelCase declarations.
7) Use meaningfull functions name.
8) Follow microservice architecture.
